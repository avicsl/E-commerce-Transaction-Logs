# Facebook Misinformation Detection Using Intelligent Systems 

This project applies intelligent forensic techniques to analyze and detect misinformation patterns on Facebook. It simulates user-generated post data, applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and anomaly detection models, and visualizes the spread of misleading information based on engagement and sentiment trends.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Generate a simulated dataset of Facebook posts with engagement metrics.  
- Preprocess and clean unstructured text data for analysis.  
- Apply **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **Sentiment Analysis** using SpaCy.  
- Use **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection of viral or suspicious posts.  
- Create visualizations to show misinformation trends and patterns.
